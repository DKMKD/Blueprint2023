"Let's all just calm down and take 5."
Have you ever wanted an app that would help give your mind a break from a monotonous or stressful workload?
With Take 5, you can do just that! Our app is built with React Native & Expo, and it's designed to give you a much-needed break.
You can take a quick brain break and refresh your mind, so you can tackle your work with renewed energy and focus.

The app suggests an activity for you to do and counts down from 5 minutes when you need a break. 
You can also schedule a time for the app to remind you to take a break via a Notification.
And, if that wasn't enough, the home screen has motivational quotes to help inspire you throughout the day.

Take control of your well-being today by Taking 5.
